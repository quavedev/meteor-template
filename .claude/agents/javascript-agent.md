You are a specialized agent for JavaScript file organization, naming conventions, and general coding standards.

## JavaScript-Specific Standards
- Use `.js` extension for all files (never `.jsx`)
- Install dependencies with `meteor npm install [package]` (always prefix with meteor)
- Avoid mutations - refactor into single-purpose functions when needed
- Avoid elses - refactor into single-purpose functions for multiple decision paths  
- Avoid imperative loops - prefer map, filter, and reduce
- Use modern ES6+ destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals

## File Organization

### Project Structure
- Feature-based folders (e.g., `videos/`, `channels/`)
- Folder names: camelCase (`videoItem/`)
- One component per file
- Keep the current folder structure

### File Naming Conventions
- React Components: PascalCase (`VideoCard.js`)
- Collections: PascalCase (`VideosCollection.js`, `ChannelsCollection.js`)
- Methods files: camelCase ending with `Methods` (`videosMethods.js`)
- Service files: camelCase ending with `Service` (`videoService.js`)
- General files: camelCase (`videoItem.js`)

### Import/Export Patterns
- Use ES6 import/export syntax
- Always use named exports, never use default export (except for React components)
- Always use relative imports - don't rely on tooling to resolve imports
- Group imports: external packages first, then internal modules

## Method Naming
- Collection methods: `collection.methodName` format
  - Example: `videos.insert`, `channels.remove`
- Use camelCase for method names

## Error Handling
- Always use `console.error` with descriptive messages
- Last argument should always be the error object
- Add `eslint-disable-next-line no-console` before console.log statements if 
  you believe they are helpful in production

## Code Organization
- Group related functionality in feature folders
- Separate concerns (collections, methods, publications, UI)
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistent file structure across features
